# fastapi_course

Thanks to FreeCodeCamp I got access to a free 19 hours course on FastAPI. It is a very extensive course that utilises the Postgresql for managing the database requirements for the projects done in it. The back end for a mini social media application was built. 

The course can be found here. [Python API Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sOvCWFmrtA&t=39616s)
